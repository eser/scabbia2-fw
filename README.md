History
-------

**Scabbia2** derived from [Scabbia Framework](https://github.com/larukedi/Scabbia-Framework/) with taken advantage of modern software tools. Since we don't have active GitHub users and online continous integration tools for free when we started 3 years ago, we think it's time to create a new branch of the existing framework idea/brand for a reset.

1.x versions had been under development by [Eser Ozvataf](http://eser.ozvataf.com/) for 2 years and reached version 1.5 on stable branch. You can take a look to the repository of [Scabbia Framework](https://github.com/larukedi/Scabbia-Framework/). It's active development is frozen but small bugfixes will be available in time.
